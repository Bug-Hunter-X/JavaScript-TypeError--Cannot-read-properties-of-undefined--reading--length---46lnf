# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error and its solution. The `bug.js` file contains code that throws a `TypeError` when an undefined value is passed to a function that attempts to access its `length` property. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that handles the undefined case gracefully.

## Bug Description
The original code attempts to determine the length of an input value, but does not handle the scenario where the value is `undefined`. Accessing `length` on an undefined object results in a runtime error.  This is a common error in JavaScript code where the programmer doesn't explicitly check for null or undefined values before using them.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a check for `undefined` or `null` before attempting to access the `length` property.  This prevents the error and provides a more robust solution.
